# Dependencies
This library has dependencies on other libraries that I use on a regular basis.

- [Arduino Logging](https://github.com/markwomack/ArduinoLogging) - Arduino
  Logging controls the debug message output.
- [Task Manager](https://github.com/markwomack/TaskManager) - Task Manager is
  a light weight framework for managing tasks that need to execute on a schedule.
  All of the CheckForXXXUpdateTask classes extend the
  [Task class](https://github.com/markwomack/TaskManager/blob/main/src/Task.h) and the
  [examples](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/tree/main/examples)
  use the TaskManager to manage the tasks.
- [Teensy Network Hub](https://github.com/markwomack/TeensyNetworkHub) - This is a
  library that will manage the connection to a network. This network hub is
  used in the [tcp_update example](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/tree/main/examples/tcp_update)
  and [tcp_to_uart tool](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/tree/main/tool/tcp_to_uart).
  WiFi Network Hub that is curently used is written to
  use the [Adafruit AirLift](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201) or an
  equivalent ESP32 board for connecting to the WiFi network. Native ethernet is also
  supported by the Teensy Network Hub, and switching is trvial. Please see the
  Teensy Network Hub home page for information.
- [WiFiNINA](https://github.com/adafruit/WiFiNINA/) - The WiFi Network Hub
  uses the the WiFiNINA library. The version it is expecting is the forked version
  maintained by Adafruit.
- [FlasherX](https://github.com/joepasquariello/FlasherX) - The code to update
  the Teensy firmware is FlasherX. The code itself is included in this library,
  but it has been slightly modified to add the CRC32 check, to remove the user
  input to proceed with the update, and to use Arduino Logging for the output
  messages. Many thanks for Joe Pasquariello for the code and his help in adapting
  it to more uses and inputs.
- [CRC32](http://home.thep.lu.se/~bjorn/crc/) - The CRC32 value that is generated
  by the [scripts](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/tree/main/scripts)
  to send the update data matches the CRC32 data generated by the
  [CRCStream](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/blob/main/src/CRCStream.h)
  class as it reads the update data. The algorithm that the CRCStream class uses is
  from Bj√∂rn Samuelsson and was found using a Google search. Many thanks to him
  for a simple and compact implementation.
