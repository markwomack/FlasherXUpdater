# Dependencies
This library has dependencies on other libraries that I use on a regular basis.

- [Arduino Logging](https://github.com/markwomack/ArduinoLogging) - Arduino
  Logging controls the debug message output.
- [Task Manager](https://github.com/markwomack/TaskManager) - Task Manager is
  a light weight framework for managing tasks that need to execute on a schedule.
  All of the CheckForXXXUpdateTask classes extend the Task class and the
  [examples](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/tree/main/examples)
  use the TaskManager to manage the tasks.
- [WiFi Network Hub](https://github.com/markwomack/WiFiNetworkHub) - This is a
  library that will manage the connection to a WiFi network. This network hub is
  used in the basic_tcp_update example. WiFi Network Hub is currently written to
  use that [Adafruit AirLift](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4201) or an
  equivalent ESP32 board for connecting to the WiFi network. The examples use
  the network hub to connect to a WiFi network.
- [WiFiNINA](https://github.com/adafruit/WiFiNINA/) - The CheckForTCPUpdateTask
  uses classes that are defined by the WiFiNINA library, and the WiFi Network
  Hub library is dependent on this library as well. The version it is expecting
  is the forked version maintained by Adafruit.
- [FlasherX](https://github.com/joepasquariello/FlasherX) - The code to update
  the Teensy firmware is FlasherX. The code itself is included in this library,
  but it has been slightly modified to add the CRC32 check, to remove the user
  input to proceed with the update, and to use Arduino Logging for the output
  messages. Many thanks for Joe Pasquariello for the code and his help in adapting
  it to more uses and inputs.
- [CRC32](http://home.thep.lu.se/~bjorn/crc/) - The CRC32 value that is generated
  by the [scripts](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/tree/main/scripts)
  to send the update data matches the CRC32 data generated by the
  [CRCStream](https://github.com/markwomack/FlasherXUpdater/blob/main/src/CRCStream.h)
  class as it reads the update data. The algorithm that the CRCStream class uses is
  from Bj√∂rn Samuelsson and was found using a Google search. Many thanks to him
  for a simple and compact implementation.
